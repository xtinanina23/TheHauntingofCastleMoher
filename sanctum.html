    <h1>Sanctum of Light</h1>
    <p>
      The Sanctum of Light is an ethereal, sacred space—its vast walls adorned with stained-glass windows that cast a kaleidoscope of colors, dancing upon the floor in shimmering patterns. 
      The air is cool, filled with the soft hum of ancient magic. At the center of the room, you see the sleeping figure of Princess Christina, her delicate form lying still beneath a soft veil of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her spirit, bound to the castle, has finally been freed by your bravery. The room, filled with a sense of quiet reverence, seems to hold its breath. The princess rests, her body glowing faintly 
      with the magic of the glass, awaiting your final gesture to return her to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment has come—the time for the final kiss is now. With the magical artifacts you have gathered, and the courage in your heart, this final act will bring the princess back.
