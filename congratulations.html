      You have completed your quest and awakened Princess Christina from her enchanted slumber. Through your courage, perseverance, and longing, the princess is now free.

      <br><br>

      Your journey, however, is far from over. As a token of her gratitude, Princess Christina will bestow upon you three sacred gifts. But she will not make it easy.

The first clue is yours for the taking...`,

rests beneath the one who holds your grin.
Not far from where dreams softly blend,
an extension of you guards the end.
Among the pillows where comfort lies,
your secret waits in gentle disguise.`
